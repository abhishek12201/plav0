### **Part 1: Introduction & The First Step (2 minutes)**

**(1.1) The Hook:**
*   "Traditional learning is one-size-fits-all. But what if you had a team of personal AI mentors dedicated to your success? Introducing the Personalized Learning Nexus, an app that assembles a team of AI agents to create a learning experience tailored just for you."
*   Show the landing page.

**(1.2) Seamless Onboarding:**
*   "Let's get started. The journey begins with our **Gatekeeper Agent**, which handles secure authentication."
*   **Action:** Click "Get Started." Register for a new account using email and password. The app will smoothly redirect you to the dashboard.
*   "And just like that, we're in. The Gatekeeper ensures your personal data is secure while giving you access to your personalized learning hub."
*   Briefly point out the empty state on the dashboard. "It's a fresh start. Let's give our mentors something to work with."

### **Part 2: The Agent Team-Up in Action (3 minutes)**

**(2.1) The Orchestrator:**
*   "Now, let's see the agents work together. We'll head to the **Study Hub** and use the **Agent Team-Up** feature."
*   **Action:** Navigate to Study Hub -> Agent Team-Up tab.
*   "I want to learn about **'Neural Networks'**. I'll give this topic to our agent team and let them handle the rest."

**(2.2) Meet the Agents:**
*   **Action:** Type "Introduction to Neural Networks" into the input field and click "Start Agent Team."
*   **Narrate the live feed as it happens:**
    1.  "First up is the **Content Retriever Agent**. Its job is to search its vast knowledge base to find and synthesize the most relevant information on our topic." (Wait for the retriever's "done" message).
    2.  "Next, the orchestrator passes this content to our **Quiz Generator Agent**. This agent's specialty is creating high-quality, personalized quizzes to test your understanding." (Wait for the quiz generator's final message).

**(2.3) Take the Quiz:**
*   "And there we have it. In seconds, our agent team has researched a topic and built a custom quiz. Let's see how I do."
*   **Action:** Answer the first few questions. Get one or two wrong on purpose to showcase the feedback capabilities later. Use the "Flag for review" button on one question.
*   "The interface is clean and distraction-free, letting me focus on the task at hand."
*   **Action:** Click "Finish Quiz."

*   Show the results screen. Point out the score.
*   "The Evaluator doesn't just give you a score; it provides deep, actionable insights. First, it has identified my specific 'Weak Concepts' based on my incorrect answers."
*   **Action:** Point to the "Key Areas to Review" box.
*   "And it offers adaptive feedback. Right now, the tone is 'Encouraging'. Let's see what that looks like."
*   **Action:** Open the accordion to show the detailed explanation for an incorrect answer.
*   "But maybe I need a more direct approach. Let's switch the tone to 'Constructive'."
*   **Action:** Change the dropdown to "Constructive." A loader will appear.
*   "The agent regenerates the feedback in real-time, giving me the exact level of support I need."

**(3.2) The Mentor Agent:**
*   "Now that we know our weak spots, what's next? For that, we turn to our wise **Mentor Agent**."
*   **Action:** Navigate to the "Study Hub" and open the "Study Plan" tab.
*   Fill in the fields based on the quiz results:
    *   **Progress:** "I've just taken a quiz on Neural Networks and understand the basics, but I'm struggling with backpropagation."
    *   **Gaps:** "Backpropagation, Activation Functions."
    *   **Objectives:** "I want to be able to explain how a simple neural network learns."
*   **Action:** Click "Generate Plan."
*   "The Mentor Agent analyzes our performance and goals to create a step-by-step, personalized study plan to turn weaknesses into strengths."
*   **Action:** Briefly read a few points from the generated study plan.
