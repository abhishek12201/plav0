### **Part 1: Introduction & The First Step (2 minutes)**

**(1.1) The Hook:**
*   "Traditional learning is one-size-fits-all. But what if you had a team of personal AI mentors dedicated to your success? Introducing the Personalized Learning Nexus, an app that assembles a team of AI agents to create a learning experience tailored just for you."
*   Show the landing page.

**(1.2) Seamless Onboarding:**
*   "Let's get started. The journey begins with our **Gatekeeper Agent**, which handles secure authentication."
*   **Action:** Click "Get Started." Register for a new account using email and password. The app will smoothly redirect you to the dashboard.
*   "And just like that, we're in. The Gatekeeper ensures your personal data is secure while giving you access to your personalized learning hub."
*   Briefly point out the empty state on the dashboard. "It's a fresh start. Let's give our mentors something to work with."

### **Part 2: Content & Quizzes (3 minutes)**

**(2.1) The Content Retriever & Quiz Generator:**
*   "Let's head to the **Quiz Center**. I want to learn about **'Neural Networks'**."
*   **Action:** Navigate to the Quiz Center.
*   "First, I need some learning material. I'll paste an article I found into the 'Learning Content' box. I'll also specify the topic."
*   **Action:** Paste pre-written content about Neural Networks into the text area. Set the topic to "Neural Networks".
*   "Now, our **Quiz Generator Agent** will get to work. It reads the content and creates a personalized quiz to test my understanding."
*   **Action:** Click "Generate Quiz".

**(2.2) Take the Quiz:**
*   "And there we have it. In seconds, our agent has built a custom quiz. Let's see how I do."
*   **Action:** Answer the first few questions. Get one or two wrong on purpose to showcase the feedback capabilities later. Use the "Flag for review" button on one question.

*   **Action:** Navigate to the "Study Hub" and open the "Study Plan" tab.
*   Fill in the fields based on the quiz results:
    *   **Progress:** "I've just taken a quiz on Neural Networks and understand the basics, but I'm struggling with backpropagation."
    *   **Gaps:** "Backpropagation, Activation Functions."
    *   **Objectives:** "I want to be able to explain how a simple neural network learns."
*   **Action:** Click "Generate Plan."
*   "The Mentor Agent analyzes our performance and goals to create a step-by-step, personalized study plan to turn weaknesses into strengths."
