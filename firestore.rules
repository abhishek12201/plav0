/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Personalized Learning Nexus.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and a public-read, owner-write model for learning materials.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/studyPlans/{studyPlanId}: Study plans owned by a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/summaries/{summaryId}: Content summaries owned by a specific user.
 * - /learningMaterials/{learningMaterialId}: Learning materials, publicly readable but only editable by the owner.
 * - /learningMaterials/{learningMaterialId}/quizzes/{quizId}: Quizzes associated with learning materials, write access should only be given to learning material owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: User's quiz attempts, only accessible by the user themselves.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Learning materials are publicly readable to facilitate discovery.
 * - The structure is designed to maintain a homogeneous security posture, enhancing debuggability by making authorization intent explicit.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Quiz' documents have a denormalized `learningMaterialId` field. This prevents requiring a `get()` on the parent `learningMaterial` document to check for ownership.
